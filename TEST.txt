#Performed slowly at first due to length and also had poor recall due to it being a large query. We implemented ranked retrieval to avoid the setbacks of boolean retrieval

OVERAL OPTIMIZATIONS:
Our intial search engine relied on an inverted index comprised of multiple organized json files. This caused efficiency issues because loading the large
json files into memory was very time consuming and led to very slow retrieval. We restructured our final index so that it was a sorted, formatted text
file. We created a dictionary to keep trap of byte offsets for each index term to get index data fast.
